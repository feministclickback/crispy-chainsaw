<h2>Workshop: "Feminist Clickback"</h2>
<h3>October 21, 2018, 4.30 p.m. in Halle</h3>
<p>Part of the Q. [kju_point] program »detail_verläufe«</p>
<p>Workshop (in German or English, depending on participants' wishes): Many people first turn to Google when they are seeking information, also about political topics. Most of them, though, only consider the few websites that show up at the top of the search results. Far-right and anti-feminist websites, especially Christian fundamentalist anti-choice groups, have seized this potential: They use search-engine optimization to spread their content. This workshop will provide more information on their strategies, the problems with the Google algorithm, and practical advice for feminist websites who want to use search-engine optimization as well.</p>
<p>Admission: Donation</p>
