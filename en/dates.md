<h2>Coming up:</h2>
  <h3>Workshop in Leipzig</h3>
  <p><em>April 14, 2018, 2-4 p.m., Social Impact Lab, Weißenfelser Straße 65H, Leipzig (unfortunately not wheelchair-accessible)</em></p>
  <p><strong>Part of the <a href="https://codegirls.de">Code Girls</a> workshop program</strong></p>
  <p>This workshop is intended to equip feminist activists who want to use search-engine optimization in their political work, or who just want to get to know the topic, with an understanding of the basics of SEO and how they can develop and implement their own strategy. No previous knowledge needed.</p>
  <p><em>Fee: 10 Euro to cover our costs. Please register <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMKbr7i-ZUJQqWYiOz1p3kgUZu2K32jzUJr0MrIj6O0athNg/viewform?c=0&w=1">here</a>.</em></p>
